# VitaSip Business Analytics Project (IEUK 2025)

This project was completed during the IEUK Finance, Professional Services & Consulting internship in Summer 2025. The core task involved analysing the sales performance of VitaSip, a premium functional beverage company, and producing strategic business recommendations based on Excel analysis.

Due to the time-limited nature of the internship, the initial deliverables focused on Excel-based data cleaning, dashboarding, and expected value modelling. Following the internship, I chose to further explore the dataset independently by applying SQL and Tableau. These self-initiated add-ons allowed me to develop and demonstrate additional skills in querying, data validation, and interactive visualisation.
