# VitaSip Business Analytics Project (IEUK 2025)

This project was completed during the **IEUK Finance, Professional Services & Consulting internship** in Summer 2025. The task involved analysing the sales performance of *VitaSip*, a premium functional beverage company, and producing strategic business recommendations.

Although the original brief did not require a specific tool, I used **Excel** as the most efficient way to clean, analyse, and present insights. Following the internship, I independently extended the project using **SQL** and **Tableau** to deepen my understanding and showcase additional skills in querying, segmentation, and interactive visualisation.

üìå **Key Deliverables & Tools**
- **Excel** ‚Äì Dashboarding, KPI tables, scenario comparison (Section 2.6)
- **SQL (SQLite)** ‚Äì Query-based analysis and segmentation (post-internship)
- **Tableau** ‚Äì Interactive dashboard for sales and customer insights (post-internship)
- **Word/PDF** ‚Äì Final report including data visuals and recommendations

## üìä Project Overview

### 1. Excel Analysis *(Internship Deliverable + Section 2.6)*

- Cleaned raw transactional data by removing anomalies, duplicates, and blanks  
- Created PivotTables for product, sales channel, and customer type performance  
- Integrated these into an **interactive dashboard** with filters and slicers  
- Built a **linked KPI table** that updated dynamically with dashboard inputs  
- Added Section 2.6 to the report post-internship to showcase this Excel work

### 2. SQL Extension *(Self-Initiated)*

- Queried and cleaned the original dataset using `SELECT`, `WHERE`, and `TRIM()`  
- Analysed revenue trends by day, customer type, and sales channel  
- Applied rolling averages and grouped performance by region and product type  

### 3. Tableau Dashboard *(Self-Initiated)*

- Designed an interactive dashboard to explore sales by product, channel, and customer  
- Used filters and segmentation tools to identify high-performing combinations  
- Presented visual insights to support pricing, marketing, and product decisions
